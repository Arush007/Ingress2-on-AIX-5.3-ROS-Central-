Purpose 

This article outlines the step-by-step process for executing the Prelims job on the ROS application hosted on an AIX UNIX 5.3 production server. It is intended for support teams, especially those new to UNIX/Linux environments. 

🖥️ Server Details 

- Central Server: USKODA01 

- IP Address: 144.250.100.185 

- Access Level: Root  

✅ Pre-Execution Checklist 

1. Ensure you have the Prelims Checklist handy. 

2. Log in to the central server. 

3. Run the following command to gain essn access: 

proj essn 

📂 Step-by-Step Execution 

1. Replication Script Validation 

Navigate to: 

cd /0b/opt/essn/rose/prod/repl/script 

List and verify file’s existence: 

ls -l | grep missred.rep 

ls -l | grep replreport.rep 

Open files using cat to inspect contents: 

cat missred.rep 

cat replreport.rep 

Validation Criteria: 

- missred.rep → Should be zero bytes, if not notify Gilbarto and Judith via E- mail and on Teams  

-  open the file replreport.rep 
→ Check the following: 

  • Start Date < End Date 

  • Update Date > End Date make sure to check the timestamps in the format HH:MM:SS as well in case of same dates. Or remember Start Date<End Date<Update Date 

If dates are incorrect, notify Gilberto or Judith. 

2. Gap Check in Replication 

Navigate to: 

cd /0b/opt/essn/rose/prod/reimb/script 

Run the gap check script: 

./chk_repl.pl ros /essn/rose/prod > ../log/chk_repl.log 2>&1 

Navigate to the log directory: 

cd /0b/opt/essn/rose/prod/reimb/log 

View the log: 

cat chk_repl.log 

Expected Output: Should contain the text "no gaps" 

If gaps are found, notify Gilberto or Judith. 

3. Run Prelims Script 

Navigate to: 

cd /0b/opt/essn/rose/prod/reimb/script 

List and verify the script: 

ls -l | grep prelim_all_sites.sh 

Execute the script: 

./prelim_all_sites.sh 

Immediately run: 

date 

This logs the execution timestamp for auditing purposes. 

You will receive an email confirmation upon successful execution. 

Notify Gilberto and Judith to review the job run and email sent from the script . 

4. Report Verification 

Navigate to: 

cd /0b/opt/essn/rose/prod/reimb/prelims 

Verify presence of 9 text files: 

ls -l | grep .txt | wc -l 

If fewer than 9 files are present: 

Check if mount points are full: 

df -g 

Investigate disk usage and resolve space issues if needed. {Take help from HOSTING_INCA_UNIX  or Rick Eilers(APTIV) for backups and deletion and get approval from Judith to delete old files or to archive and transfer files to the development Server  

Review reports using: 

cat <filename>
